      title: "Unforgettable Anniversary Celebration!",
      text: "MiniFlicks truly delivered an unforgettable anniversary celebration for us on our anniversary day 20th March 2024. The owners' warm and welcoming demeanor added to the charm of our experience. The high-quality sound system and screen enhanced our enjoyment of the event, while the stunning decorations created a magical atmosphere. Despite our last-minute cake order, they graciously arranged it, even late at night. We were all thrilled by the special touches like fog and rose petals entry, offered at a minimal cost. Moreover, the affordability of the three-hour package, inclusive of all facilities, surpassed our expectations. Conveniently located near Jeevika hospital, accessibility was never an issue. Highly recommend MiniFlicks for any special occasion!",
